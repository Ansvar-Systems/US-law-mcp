Entries affecting creditworthiness include, but are not limited to, payment information, defaults, judgments, liens, bankruptcies, collections, records of arrest and indictments, and multiple credit inquiries.\n\n(6) \"Debit card\" means a card or device issued by a financial institution to a consumer for use in initiating an electronic fund transfer from the account holding assets of the consumer at that financial institution, for the purpose of transferring money between accounts or obtaining money, property, labor, or services.\n\n(7) \"Disposal\" means the:\n\n(a) discarding or abandonment of records containing personal identifying information; or\n\n(b) sale, donation, discarding, or transfer of any medium, including computer equipment or computer media, containing records of personal identifying information, other nonpaper media upon which records of personal identifying information are stored, or other equipment for nonpaper storage of information.\n\n(8) \"File\" means all information on a consumer that is recorded and retained by a consumer credit-reporting agency, regardless of how the information is stored.\n\n(9) \"Financial identity fraud\" and \"identity fraud\" are as defined in § 16-13-510 and include the term \"identity theft\".\n\n(10) \"Person\" means a natural person, an individual, or an organization as defined in § 37-1-301(20).\n\n(11)(a) For purposes of this chapter, \"personal identifying information\" means personal identifying information as defined in § 16-13-510(D).\n\n(b) \"Personal identifying information\" does not mean information about vehicular accidents, driving violations, and driver’s status.\n\n(12) \"Proper identification\" means information generally considered sufficient to identify a person.

Good faith acquisition of personal identifying information by an employee or agent of the person for a legitimate purpose is not a security breach, if the personal identifying information is not used for a purpose other than a lawful purpose of the person and is not subject to further unauthorized disclosure.\n\n(16) \"Security freeze\" means a notice placed in a consumer credit report, at the request of the consumer and subject to certain exceptions, that prohibits the consumer credit-reporting agency from releasing a credit report containing all or any part of the consumer’s credit report or any information derived from it without the express authorization of the consumer.\n\nAt McGowan, Hood, Felder & Phillips, LLC, we fight hard on behalf of th…",
