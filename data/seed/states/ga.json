      "text": "(a) Any information broker or data collector that maintains computerized data that includes personal information of individuals shall give notice of any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach of the security of the system to any resident of this state whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. Such notice shall be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, as provided in subsection (c) of this Code section, or with any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity, security, and confidentiality of the data system.\n\n(b)(1) Any person or business that maintains computerized data that includes personal information of individuals that the person or business does not own shall notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the system as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay following discovery if the personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.\n(2) Any person or business that is required to issue a notification pursuant to this Code section shall simultaneously send such notification to the consumer protection division of the Attorney General's office.\n\n(c) The notification required by this Code section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines and advises the information broker or data collector that the notification will compromise a criminal investigation. The notification required by this Code section shall be made after such law enforcement agency determines that the notification will not compromise the investigation.\n\n(d) For purposes of this Code section, the term \"breach of the security of the system\" means unauthorized acquisition of an individual's electronic data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information of such individual maintained by an information broker or data collector. Good faith acquisition of personal information by an employee or agent of an information broker or data collector for the purposes of such information broker or data collector is not a breach of the security of the system, provided that the personal information is not used for, or subject to, further unauthorized disclosure.\n\n(e) The notice required by this Code section may be provided by one of the following methods:\n(1) Written notice;\n(2) Electronic notice, if the notice provided is consistent with the provisions regarding electronic records and signatures set forth in the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act;\n(3) Substitute notice, if the information broker or data collector demonstrates that the cost of providing notice would exceed $50,000.00, or that the affected class of individuals to be notified exceeds 100,000, or that the information broker or data collector does not have sufficient contact information.\n\n(f) An information broker or data collector that maintains its own notification procedures as part of an information privacy policy or security policy shall be deemed to be in compliance with the notification requirements of this Code section if the procedures are otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of this Code section.",
