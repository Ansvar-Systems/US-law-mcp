      "text": "(a) An individual or a commercial entity that conducts business in Guam and that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information about a Guam resident shall, when it becomes aware of a breach of the security of the system, conduct in good faith a reasonable and prompt investigation to determine the likelihood that personal information has been or will be used for an unauthorized purpose.

The notification required by this section shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that the notification will not compromise the investigation.\n(d) Notice required by this section may be provided by one of the following methods: (1) Written notice; (2) Electronic notice, if the notice provided is consistent with the provisions regarding electronic records and signatures set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 7001; (3) Substitute notice, if the individual or the commercial entity demonstrates that the cost of providing notice will exceed $10,000, that the affected class of Guam residents to be notified exceeds 5,000, or that the individual or commercial entity does not have sufficient contact information to provide written or electronic notice.",
