      "text": "A. Any person that conducts business in this state and that owns, maintains or licenses unencrypted and unredacted computerized personal information shall conduct a reasonable investigation promptly after discovering a breach of the security system. If the investigation results in a determination that there has been a breach of the security of the system, the person shall notify the individuals affected. The notification shall be made in the most expedient manner possible and without unreasonable delay subject to the needs of law enforcement as provided in subsection D of this section and any measures necessary to determine the nature and scope of the breach, to identify the individuals affected or to restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.\n\nB. A person that conducts business in this state and that owns, maintains or licenses unencrypted and unredacted computerized data that includes personal information shall notify the individuals affected and the attorney general within forty-five days after the determination that there has been a breach of the security of the system. If the breach requires notification of more than one thousand individuals, the person also shall notify the three largest nationwide consumer reporting agencies.\n\nC. A person that maintains unencrypted and unredacted computerized data that includes personal information that the person does not own shall notify and cooperate with the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the system immediately after the discovery of the breach.\n\nD. The notification required by this section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency advises that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. The notification required by this section shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that the notification will not compromise the investigation.\n\nE. The notification pursuant to subsection A of this section shall include at a minimum: 1. The approximate date of the breach. 2. A brief description of the personal information included in the breach. 3. The toll-free numbers, addresses and websites for the three largest nationwide consumer reporting agencies. 4.

Substitute notice if the person demonstrates that the cost of providing notice pursuant to paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection would exceed fifty thousand dollars, the affected class of individuals to be notified exceeds one hundred thousand persons or the person does not have sufficient contact information. Substitute notice shall consist of all of the following: (a) A written letter to the attorney general that demonstrates the facts necessary for substitute notice. (b) Conspicuous posting of the notice for at least forty-five days on the website of the person if the person maintains one.\n\nG. If a breach of the security of the system involves a person's user name or e-mail address, in combination with a password or security question and answer, that allows access to the person's online account, the person who owns, maintains or licenses the computerized data may comply by providing the notification in electronic or other form that directs the individual to promptly change the individual's password and security question and answer, or to take other steps that are appropriate to protect the online account.\n\nH. A person that maintains its own notification procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal information and that is otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of this section is deemed to be in compliance with the notification requirements of this section if the person notifies individuals who are affected in accordance with the person's policies in the event of a breach of the security of the system.\n\nI. A person that complies with the notification requirements or procedures pursuant to the rules, regulations, procedures or guidelines established by the person's primary or functional federal regulator is deemed to be in compliance with this section.\n\nJ. No notification is required under this section if, after a reasonable investigation, the person determines that the breach of the security of the system has not resulted and is not reasonably likely to result in substantial economic loss to affected individuals.\n\nK. For purposes of this section, \"personal information\" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when the data element is not encrypted, redacted or secured by any other method rendering the element unreadable or unusable: 1.

Personal information does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state or local government records or widely distributed media.\n\nL. A violation of this section is an unlawful practice pursuant to section 44-1522. The attorney general shall enforce this section. The attorney general may impose a civil penalty against a person that intentionally violates this section of not more than ten thousand dollars per breach or the amount of economic loss sustained by affected individuals, whichever is greater. Civil penalties shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars per event.\n\nM. This section supersedes and preempts any municipal or county ordinance, motion, resolution or amendment adopted before, on or after the effective date of this section relating to notification of security system breaches.\n\nN. This section does not apply to: 1. A person that is subject to and in compliance with title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (P.L. 106-102; 15 United States Code sections 6801 through 6827). 2.
