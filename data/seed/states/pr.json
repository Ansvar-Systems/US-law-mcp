The notification required by this section shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that the notification will not compromise the investigation.\n(e) Notice may be provided by one of the following methods: (1) Written notice; (2) Electronic notice, if the notice is consistent with the provisions regarding electronic records and signatures set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 7001; (3) Substitute notice, if the entity demonstrates that the cost of providing notice would exceed $100,000, or that the affected class of subject persons to be notified exceeds 100,000, or the entity does not have sufficient contact information. Substitute notice shall consist of all of the following: (i) E-mail notice when the entity has an e-mail address for the subject persons; (ii) Conspicuous posting of the notice on the entity's Internet website; and (iii) Notification to major statewide media.\n(f) An entity that maintains its own notification procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal information and is otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of this chapter shall be deemed to be in compliance if the entity notifies subject persons in accordance with its policies.",
