      "text": "(a) A consumer credit reporting agency, as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(p), that owns, licenses, or maintains personal information about a California resident, or a third party that maintains personal information about a California resident on behalf of a consumer credit reporting agency, that knows, or reasonably should know, that a computer system it owns, operates, or maintains, and for which it controls the security protocols, is subject to a security vulnerability that poses a significant risk, as defined in subdivision (c), to the security of computerized data that contains personal information, as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 1798.82, shall do all of the following:\n\n(1) If a consumer credit reporting agency knows or reasonably should know that a software update is available to address the vulnerability as described in subdivision (a), the agency shall begin the necessary testing, planning, and assessment of its systems for implementation of that software update in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, in keeping with industry best practices, but in any case no later than three business days after becoming aware, or after the point at which it reasonably should have become aware, of the vulnerability and the available software update. The software update shall be completed in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, in keeping with industry best practices, but in any case no later than 90 days after becoming aware, or after the point at which it reasonably should have become aware, of the vulnerability and the available software update.\n\n(2) Until the software update described in paragraph (1) is complete, the consumer credit reporting agency shall, in keeping with industry best practices, employ reasonable compensating controls to reduce the risk of a breach caused by computer system vulnerability as described in subdivision (a).\n\n(b) Notwithstanding whether a software update is available, the consumer credit reporting agency, in keeping with industry best practices, shall do all of the following:\n\n(1) Identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk security vulnerabilities most quickly in order to reduce the likelihood that the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest security risk will be exploited.\n\n(2) Test and evaluate the impact of compensating controls and software updates and how they affect the vulnerability of the system to threats to the security of computerized data.\n\n(3) Require, by contract, that the third party implement and maintain appropriate security measures for personal information. Contracting with a third party to maintain personal information about California residents shall not relieve the consumer credit agency of the requirements of this section.\n\n(c) As used in this section, “significant risk” means a vulnerability score, calculated using a standard measurement system that is accepted as a best practice for the industry, to determine that the risk could reasonably result in a breach of the security of the system, as defined in subdivision (g) of Section 1798.82, of personal information, as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 1798.82.\n\n(d) As used in this section, “compensating controls” means controls that the agency reasonably believes will prevent the computer system vulnerability as described in subdivision (a) from being exploited while the software update is being tested, assessed, and a plan for implementation is being developed, and have been adequately tested and confirmed to sufficiently offset the risk of breach caused by computer system vulnerability as described in subdivision (a).\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall reduce the responsibilities and obligations of a consumer credit reporting agency or third party under this title, including, but not limited to, Section 1798.81.5.\n\n(f) The Attorney General has exclusive authority to enforce this section.\n\n(Added by Stats. 2018, Ch. 532, Sec. 1.

to the public, in its privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to that disclosure, or of not disclosing the personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option that prevents that information from being disclosed to third parties for those purposes, as long as the business maintains and discloses the policies, the business may comply with subdivision

Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way this subdivision shall be void and unenforceable.\n\n(Amended November 3, 2020, by initiative Proposition 24, Sec. 13.

For good cause and only to the extent necessary for investigatory purposes, a law enforcement agency may direct a business not to delete the consumer’s personal information for additional 90-day periods. A business that has received direction from a law enforcement agency not to delete the personal information of a consumer who has requested deletion of the consumer’s personal information shall not use the consumer’s personal information for any purpose other than retaining it to produce to law enforcement in response to a court-issued subpoena, order, or warrant unless the consumer’s deletion request is subject to an exemption from deletion under this title.\n\n(C) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the business, service provider, or third party reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local law.\n\n(D) (i) Cooperate with a government agency request for emergency access to a consumer’s personal information if a natural person is at risk or danger of death or serious physical injury provided that:\n\n(I) The request is approved by a high-ranking agency officer for emergency access to a consumer’s personal information.\n\n(II) The request is based on the agency’s good faith determination that it has a lawful basis to access the information on a nonemergency basis.\n\n(III) The agency agrees to petition a court for an appropriate order within three days and to destroy the information if that order is not granted.\n\n(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a consumer accessing, procuring, or searching for services regarding contraception, pregnancy care, and perinatal care, including, but not limited to, abortion services, shall not constitute a natural person being at risk or danger of death or serious physical injury.\n\n(E) Exercise or defend legal claims.\n\n(F) Collect, use, retain, sell, share, or disclose consumers’ personal information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.\n\n(G) Collect, sell, or share a consumer’s personal information if every aspect of that commercial conduct takes place wholly outside of California.

This paragraph shall not prohibit a business from storing, including on a device, personal information about a consumer when the consumer is in California and then collecting that personal information when the consumer and stored personal information is outside of California.\n\n(2) (A) This subdivision shall not apply if the consumer’s personal information contains information related to

Nothing in this section shall require a business to divulge trade secrets.\n\n(16) Issuing regulations governing access and opt-out rights with respect to businesses’ use of automated decisionmaking technology, including profiling and requiring businesses’ response to access requests to include meaningful information about the logic involved in those decisionmaking processes, as well as a description of the likely outcome of the process with respect to the consumer.\n\n(17) Issuing regulations to further define a “law enforcement agency-approved investigation” for purposes of the exception in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.145.\n\n(18) Issuing regulations to define the scope and process for the exercise of the agency’s audit authority, to establish criteria for selection of persons to audit, and to protect consumers’ personal information from disclosure to an auditor in the absence of a court order, warrant, or subpoena.\n\n(19) (A) Issuing regulations to define the requirements and technical specifications for an opt-out preference signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, to indicate a consumer’s intent to opt out of the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information and to limit the use or disclosure of the consumer’s sensitive personal information. The requirements and specifications for the opt-out preference signal should be updated from time to time to reflect the means by which consumers interact with businesses, and should:\n\n(i) Ensure that the manufacturer of a platform or browser or device that sends the opt-out preference signal cannot unfairly disadvantage another business.\n\n(ii) Ensure that the opt-out preference signal is consumer-friendly, clearly described, and easy to use by an average consumer and does not require that the consumer provide additional information beyond what is necessary.\n\n(iii) Clearly represent a consumer’s intent and be free of defaults constraining or presupposing that intent.\n\n(iv) Ensure that the opt-out preference signal does not conflict with other commonly used privacy settings or tools that consumers may employ.\n\n(v) Provide a mechanism for the consumer to selectively consent to a business’s sale of the consumer’s personal information, or the use or disclosure of the consumer’s sensitive personal information, without affecting the consumer’s preferences with respect to other businesses or disabling the opt-out preference signal globally.\n\n(vi) State that in the case of a page or setting view that the consumer accesses to set the opt-out preference signal, the consumer should see up to three choices, including:\n\n(I) Global opt out from sale and sharing of personal information, including a direction to limit the use of sensitive personal information.\n\n(II) Choice to “Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information.”\n\n(III) Choice titled “Do Not Sell/Do Not Share My Personal Information for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising.”\n\n(B) Issuing regulations to establish technical specifications for an opt-out preference signal that allows the consumer, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, to specify that the consumer is less than 13 years of age or at least 13 years of age and less than 16 years of age.\n\n(C) Issuing regulations, with the goal of strengthening consumer privacy while considering the legitimate operational interests of businesses, to govern the use or disclosure of a consumer’s sensitive personal information, notwithstanding the consumer’s direction to limit the use or disclosure of the consumer’s sensitive personal information, including:\n\n(i) Determining any additional purposes for which a business may use or disclose a consumer’s sensitive personal information.\n\n(ii) Determining the scope of activities permitted under paragraph (8) of subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140, as authorized by subdivision (a) of Section 1798.121, to ensure that the activities do not involve health-related research.\n\n(iii) Ensuring the functionality of the business’s operations.\n\n(iv) Ensuring that the exemption in subdivision (d) of Section 1798.121 for sensitive personal information applies to information that is collected or processed incidentally, or without the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer, while ensuring that businesses do not use the exemption for the purpose of evading consumers’ rights to limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information under Section 1798.121.\n\n(20) Issuing regulations to govern how a business that has elected to comply with subdivision (b) of Section 1798.135 responds to the opt-out preference signal and provides consumers with the opportunity subsequently to consent to the sale or sharing of their personal information or the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information for purposes in addition to those authorized by subdivision (a) of Section 1798.121.
