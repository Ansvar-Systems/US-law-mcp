# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer, legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the American Bar Association (ABA) and state bar associations must comply with the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (particularly Rules 1.1, 1.6, and 5.3) and applicable state rules when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules in your jurisdiction require disclosing AI tool use to clients, particularly under ABA Model Rule 1.4 (Communication) and emerging state-specific AI disclosure requirements

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Congress.gov for federal statutes, Federal Register for regulations, GovInfo at govinfo.gov, and state legislature portals for state law)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force and has not been amended or repealed
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting case law from federal and state courts, legislative history, and agency guidance
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official United States legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official government databases (Congress.gov, Federal Register, GovInfo, state portals)** | Authoritative | Statute and regulation text (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources** | Supplementary | Legal summaries, cross-references (verify independently) |
| **International treaty databases** | Authoritative for international law | International obligations metadata |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- Westlaw (Thomson Reuters), LexisNexis, Bloomberg Law

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations (headnotes, KeyCite/Shepard's), and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- United States law changes continuously through new federal and state legislation, agency rulemaking, executive orders, and court decisions
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the Federal Register or state gazettes
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended after the last database update
  - Repealed but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to effective date or sunset provisions affecting its applicability
  - Preempted by federal law or struck down by a court
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law** -- Coverage is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research from the Supreme Court, federal circuits, district courts, or state courts
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording
3. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial annotations, law review articles, treatises, or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Unpublished opinions and administrative rulings largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of committee reports, floor debates, and conference reports
6. **State and local law** -- Coverage of all 50 states, territories, and local ordinances may be incomplete
7. **Administrative agency guidance** -- Advisory opinions, no-action letters, and informal guidance largely absent

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary and legislative history, interpretation may be incorrect
- **Federalism Blind Spots**: The U.S. dual-sovereign system means state law may differ significantly and may be missed
- **Preemption Issues**: Cannot fully assess federal preemption of state law
- **International Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess international treaty obligations or compliance

## No Warranties

### "AS IS" -- No Guarantees

Per the Apache 2.0 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

- **NO WARRANTY OF ACCURACY**: Data may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information
- **NO WARRANTY OF COMPLETENESS**: Searches may miss relevant provisions or cases
- **NO WARRANTY OF FITNESS**: Not warranted as fit for professional legal use
- **NO WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT**: No guarantee that use complies with professional rules or regulations

### Limitation of Liability

- Authors and contributors are **NOT LIABLE** for damages arising from use of this Tool
- This includes but is not limited to:
  - Professional malpractice claims
  - Lost cases or adverse judgments
  - Client harm from erroneous advice
  - Regulatory sanctions or bar discipline
  - Reputational damage

## AI-Generated Content

This Tool uses **algorithmic search and ranking** that may:

- Return irrelevant or misleading results
- Miss critical provisions
- Rank less relevant provisions higher than more relevant ones
- Make errors in parsing, citation formatting, or cross-referencing
- Generate "hallucinated" citations (references to provisions that do not exist)

**Human review is MANDATORY** before relying on any AI-generated search results or analysis. The risk of AI hallucination in legal citations has been recognized by courts (see, e.g., *Mata v. Avianca*, S.D.N.Y. 2023).

## AI Regulation Considerations

The United States is developing AI regulation at both the federal and state levels. This Tool is a **general-purpose AI system** used for legal research and is NOT designed for high-risk applications such as judicial decision-making.

### Transparency Obligations

- **AI Disclosure**: This Tool uses AI/algorithmic methods for search and ranking
- **User Awareness**: Users are notified that results are AI-generated and require verification
- **Transparency**: This documentation provides information about limitations and risks

### User Obligations

- **Verify AI Output**: Always verify AI-generated citations and search results
- **Human Oversight**: Do not use Tool output in professional legal work without human review
- **Professional Rules**: Comply with applicable ABA Model Rules and state bar rules regarding AI tool use
- **Court Requirements**: Some courts require disclosure of AI-assisted research; check local rules

## Professional Ethics Considerations

### Confidentiality

- See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for detailed confidentiality considerations
- **Query Data**: Queries made through the Claude API may be logged by Anthropic (subject to their privacy policy)
- **Client Information**: Do not include client names, case-specific details, or confidential information in queries
- **Sensitive Matters**: For privileged legal matters (attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine), consider on-premise deployment
- **ABA Model Rule 1.6**: Duty to make reasonable efforts to prevent inadvertent disclosure of confidential information

### Competence and Diligence

Using this Tool does not reduce your professional obligations to:

- Exercise independent legal judgment (ABA Model Rule 2.1)
- Maintain competence, including understanding AI tool limitations (ABA Model Rule 1.1, Comment [8])
- Conduct thorough legal research using authoritative sources
- Stay current with legal developments
- Provide competent representation

## Recommended Workflow for Professional Use

1. **Initial Research**: Use Tool for preliminary research and hypothesis generation
2. **Official Verification**: Cross-check ALL results with official sources (Congress.gov, Federal Register, GovInfo, state legislature portals)
3. **Commercial Databases**: Use professional legal databases (Westlaw, LexisNexis, Bloomberg Law) for authoritative, annotated versions with KeyCite/Shepard's citation verification
4. **Professional Judgment**: Apply independent legal analysis and professional judgment
5. **Document Sources**: Cite official sources in legal work, not this Tool
6. **Update Check**: Before finalizing legal work, check for recent amendments, new regulations, and court decisions
